# CFA-CSS-Zen

## Problem

The goal of this challenge was to make our own CSS file for the CSS Zen Garden Challenge (http://www.csszengarden.com). We were challenged to keeping to the Zen Garden rules of not altering the HTML and writing our own CSS without the use of bootstrap or other frameworks.

## Result

The end result is not that exciting in my opinion. It is very simple and I didn't actually change much of the original-CSS-less layout - just played around with colors, fonts and footers etc.

## Challenges

This was just challenging overall because it was one of the first times I had properly explored CSS design and felt like I was thrown in the deep end! I was overwhelmed with so much new syntax and hence just tried to get my head around that initially and hence didn't make massive strides in making the end-result something exciting!

### That's it for now folks!
